calculate (&key hub rim washer spoke nipple spoke-count spoke-crossings
           spoke-tension spoke-tension-method rim-offset-orientation
           nipple-head-extent)
   Calculate the spoke lengths for a wheel assembly.

   Keyword arguments HUB, RIM, WASHER, SPOKE, and NIPPLE define the
    components of the wheel assembly.  Only HUB and RIM are mandatory.
    If WASHER is a number, it defines the thickness of the washer in
    millimeter.
   Keyword argument SPOKE-COUNT is the number of spokes.  Value is
    either 20, 24, 28, 32, or 36.  Default is 32.
   Keyword argument SPOKE-CROSSINGS is the number of spoke crossings.
    Value is either 0 (radial), 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Default is 3.
   Keyword argument SPOKE-TENSION is the spoke tension in kilogram
    when truing the wheel.  Value has to be a non-negative number.
    Default is 120 kilogram.  The spoke tension is used to estimate
    the elongation of the spokes.  This information can be used to
    adjust the actual spoke length.
   Keyword argument SPOKE-TENSION-METHOD defines how to apply the
    SPOKE-TENSION parameter.  Value is either ‘:max’, ‘:min’, or
    ‘:mean’ to apply the spoke tension as the maximum, minimum,
    or mean spoke tension respectively.  Default is ‘:max’.
   Keyword argument RIM-OFFSET-ORIENTATION defines the orientation of
    an asymmetric rim.  Value is either ‘:left’, ‘:right’, or ‘:auto’.
    Default is ‘:auto’.  A value of ‘:left’ means, that the spoke holes
    are to the left of the middle of the rim.  A value of ‘:right’ means,
    that the the spoke holes are to the right of the middle of the rim.
    A value of ‘:auto’ means, that the rim orientation is selected in
    such a way that the tension ratio is improved.
   Keyword argument NIPPLE-HEAD-EXTENT is the additional spoke length in
    millimeter that extends from the rim (washer) contact point into the
    nipple head.  Value has to be a number.  Default is 2 millimeter.
    DT Swiss uses 2 millimeter for their ERD calculation.

   The value of the SPOKE, NIPPLE, SPOKE-COUNT, and SPOKE-CROSSINGS
   argument is either an object as documented above or a cons cell where
   the ‘car’ denotes the left-hand side object and the ‘cdr’ denotes the
   right-hand side object.  The SPOKE-COUNT and SPOKE-CROSSINGS values
   define the spoke's lacing pattern.

   See also ‘hub’, ‘rim’, ‘washer’, ‘spoke’, and ‘nipple’.

   Return the sine of NUMBER given in degree angle.

spoke-area ((spoke spoke))
   The cross-sectional area of the spoke on the middle section.

                                                                        [Method]
spoke-diameter ((spoke spoke))
   The diameter of the spoke at the head.

                                                                      [Function]
spoke-elongation (spoke length tension)
   Calculate the elongation of a spoke under tension load.

   First argument SPOKE is a ‘spoke’ object.
   Second argument LENGTH is the length of the spoke in millimeter.
   Third argument TENSION is the spoke tension in kilogram.  Value
    has to be a non-negative number.

   The cross-sectional area and the length of the spoke's middle section
   and the material of the spoke must be defined.  See the ‘spoke-area’,
   ‘spoke-middle-section’, and ‘spoke-material’ methods of the ‘spoke’
   class.

   Primary value is the elongation of the spoke in millimeter.  Secondary
   value is true if the corresponding stress is less than or equal to the
   spoke's strength.

                                                                        [Method]
